# GDP vs. CO2 Emissions - Regression
# Abstract
This project seeks to investigate the correlation in countries' GDPs with their annual greenhouse gas emissions. This can be used to evaluate the economic implications of using fossil-fuels vs. renewable energy, and to assess how feasible it would be for developing countries to adopt net-zero emission policies while upholding their economic growth objectives.
